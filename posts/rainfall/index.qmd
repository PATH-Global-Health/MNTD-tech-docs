## About CHIRPS

The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is a quasi-global rainfall dataset spanning 1981 to present. The rainfall data is available as daily, pentadaily (5-day), and monthly raster files at a resolution of 0.05Â°. This post covers how to obtain CHIRPS data using the `PATHtools` package for projects requiring areal data, e.g., summary data for health districts or regions. It also provides a brief introduction to the [`chirps` R package](https://docs.ropensci.org/chirps/), which downloads data at user-defined points, e.g., health facilities or households.

Learn more about CHIRPS at [UCSB's Climate Hazards Center](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps).

## Areal data

The `PATHtools` `rainfall()` function allows you to extract estimates of average rainfall across one or more areas saved as project shapefiles. First, install `PATHtools`.

```{r message=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
devtools::install_github("PATH-Global-Health/PATHtools")
```

Next, read in a shapefile of Zambia's provinces from the package and obtain daily rainfall estimates for each polygon (province). Note the arguments for the `daily_rainfall()` function: The **start_date** and **end_date** are the beginning and end boundaries of your time period, and must be supplied in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. The shapefile **shp** should be an **sf** object of the POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON class.

```{r}
library(PATHtools)

#Load shapefile
shp <- load_shapefile(country = "Zambia", admin_level = 1)

#Obtain daily rainfall for 2012-01-01 through 2012-01-31 in WIDE FORMAT
start_date <- "2012-01-01"
end_date <- "2012-01-31"
rain_areal <- daily_rainfall(c(start_date, end_date),shp)

#View rainfall data for first 5 days
rain_areal[,1:9]
```

The default data format from `daily_rainfall()` is wide. To obtain the data in long format, set the argument **long** equal to TRUE.

```{r}
#Obtain daily rainfall for 2012-01-01 through 2012-01-31 in LONG FORMAT
rain_areal_long <- daily_rainfall(c(start_date, end_date),shp, long = TRUE)

#View rainfall data for first 5 days in Central Province
rain_areal_long[1:5,]
```

Finally, to obtain CHIRPS rasters, set the argument **output_raster** equal to TRUE.

```{r}
#Obtain daily rainfall rasters for 2012-01-01 through 2012-01-31
rain_areal_raster <- daily_rainfall(c(start_date, end_date), shp, output_raster = TRUE)

#Plot raster for January 1, 2012
terra::plot(rain_areal_raster$`chirps_2012-01-01`)
```

## Point data

To get estimated daily rainfall at specified locations, such as health facilities, we can use the `chirps` package. Here, we'll create a data.frame of points and download their data.

```{r message=FALSE}
install.packages("chirps", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(chirps)

#Create points object
points <- data.frame(lon = c(28.287, 28.213, 28.637, 28.446), lat = c(-15.407, -12.802, -12.959, -14.447))

#Obtain daily rainfall for 2012-01-01 through 2012-01-31
start_date <- "2012-01-01"
end_date <- "2012-01-31"
rain_point <- get_chirps(points, c(start_date, end_date), server = "ClimateSERV")

#View first few rows
head(rain_point)
```

## Aggregating data from daily to monthly

To get monthly data, we aggregate the above objects.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

#Aggregate areal data to monthly totals
rain_areal_long_monthly <- rain_areal_long %>%
  group_by(ADM1, month = floor_date(date, "month")) %>%
  summarise(rainfall = sum(rainfall))

rain_areal_long_monthly

#Aggregate point data to monthly totals
rain_point_monthly <- rain_point %>%
  group_by(lon, lat, month = floor_date(date, "month")) %>%
  summarise(chirps = sum(chirps))

rain_point_monthly
```
