The goal of PATH Malaria & NTDs Technical Docs is to development and maintain documentation of our analytical workflows both internally and externally.

Examples will try to rely on data is publicly accessible and well-maintained to ensure that they are relevant and reproducible. If internal data must be use, we will strive to anonymized sensitive information and provide either anonymized or simulated data within the post.
